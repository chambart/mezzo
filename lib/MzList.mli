(** Same as [map2] but pass an extra parameter that represents the index *)

(** Same as [fold_right] except that the function takes the current index in the
   list. The index starts counting from the right of the list, so the first call
   will pass 0 for [i]. *)

(** Same as [fold_left] except that the function takes the current index in the
   list *)

(** Same as [fold_left2] except that the function takes the current index in the

(** Same as [fold_left2] but with three lists. *)

(** Same as [fold_left], but start folding on the head of the list instead of
    giving an initial element. *)

(** Same as [List.iteri] but with two lists. *)

(** Same as [List.split] but for triples instead of pairs. *)

(** [make n f] creates [[f 1; ...; f n]]. *)

(** Map a function and then discard the result. *)

    [Some (x1, x2)] where [x1] and [x2] are distinct elements of the list [xs] such
    that [compare x1 x2] is zero, or [None], if no such two elements exist. *)

(** Checking for duplicates in a list. The comparison function operates on values

    maps ['a] to ['b]. If a duplicate element is found, the exit function is
    invoked. *)

(** Map and discard some elements at the same time. *)
val map_some: ('a -> 'b option) -> 'a list -> 'b list

(** Find the index of the first element in a list that satisfies a predicate. *)
val index: ('a -> bool) -> 'a list -> int

(** If [f] may convert an 'a into a 'b, then [take f l] returns the first
   convertible element in the list, along with the remaining elements in the
