(* Syntactic categories of names. *)

(* We assume that names are hash-consed (or internalized, in Java parlance)
   on the fly by the lexer, so the lexer produces integer codes for names. *)

(* Term variables, type variables, type constructors, fields are not
   syntactically distinguished. Placing term variables, type variables, and
   type constructors within a single syntactic category is natural because
   they share certain mechanisms (e.g. types and terms can be abstracted over
   them). They will be distinguished using sorts. Placing term variables and
   fields within a single syntactic category is natural because we wish to
   allow puns. *)

%token<int> LIDENT

(* As in ocaml, we set up a separate namespace for data constructors. This allows
   distinguishing variables and data constructors in a pattern. (Another solution
   would be to require data constructors to be explicitly followed with braces.) *)

(* Syntax for tuples. *)

(* I would have liked to use curly braces and semicolons, by analogy with
   records, but this would be too extreme: (1) it would impact the syntax
   of multiple-argument functions and (2) it would depart from the mathematical
   notation for tuples. *)

(* I thought for a moment that, in order to avoid a conflict with the
   standard use of parentheses as a desambiguation construct, tuples
   of length one would have to be made syntactically unavailable. I
   have changed my mind, because this position is untenable; tuples
   of length one are actually useful, e.g. in a function type of the
   form [(x: t) -> u] or [(consumes t) -> u]. So, my new position is,
   tuples are unrestricted, and there is no other use of parentheses.
   A post-processing phase determines how tuples of length one should
   be interpreted. *)

(* Syntax for type/type applications. *)

(* Applications of types to types are based on juxtaposition, just like
   applications of terms to terms. *)

(* Within the syntax of types, type/type applications are considered
   binary, but in certain places, as in the left-hand side of a data
   type definition, we must allow iterated applications. *)

(* Syntax for binding type variables. *)

(* Because the syntax of type/type applications is juxtaposition, the
   syntax of type variable bindings must be atomic (well-delimited). *)

    { x, KType }

(* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* Types and permissions. *)

(* Because types and permissions are distinguished via the kind system, they
   are not (and must not be) distinguished in the syntax. Thus, the
   productions that concern permissions (the empty permission, anchored
   permissions, permission conjunction, etc.) appear as part of the syntax of
   types. *)

(* It seems difficult to avoid conflicts in the syntax of function
   types. One sure thing is, we wish to allow traditional function types of
   the form [typ -> typ], because these will remain common.  However, we
   also want to allow multi-argument dependent function types, of the form
   [(x: typ, ..., x: typ) -> ... ]. As a consequence, it seems that we must
   view [(x: typ, ..., x:typ)] as a type. Since the syntax of tuple types is
   [(typ, ..., typ)], it seems that we must identify these two forms, that
   is, we must allow tuple types that bind names for their
   components. Finally, there is an artificial ambiguity because (x: typ) is
   a type (of kind KPerm). It is not a real ambiguity because the tuple type
   [(x: typ, ..., x: typ)] is ill-kinded if each (x: typ) is viewed as a
   permission. We must simply adjust the syntax of tuple types so that the
   types that appear within tuples cannot be anchored permissions. In
   conclusion, we allow a component of a tuple type to be optionally
   named. It is up to a post-processing phase to determine what this name
   means and how it be should de-sugared into normal tuple types. For the
   same reason, we allow a component of a tuple type to carry the [CONSUMES]
   keyword. This does not make sense in a normal tuple type, but makes sense
   if this tuple serves as a function argument. *)

(* Every function argument is optionally annotated with [CONSUMES]. Every
   function argument must come with a type. At worst, this type can be
   [UNKNOWN], if one does not really wish to specify a type. *)

%inline tuple_type_component:
  m = function_parameter_modifier (* optional CONSUMES annotation *)
  a = tuple_type_component_aux
    { m, a }

(* The [CONSUMES] annotation is explicit, while the default is that
   (permissions for) function arguments are consumed and produced. *)

function_parameter_modifier:
| (* by default, permission is consumed and produced *)
    { ConsumesAndProduces }
| CONSUMES
    { Consumes }

(* A tuple type component can be either a value (which exists at runtime)
   or a permission. This is natural, because we allow the same flexibility
   in records, and because we need this flexibility in order to specify
   function domains and codomains. If it is a value, it can be either
   anonymous or named. *)

(* I considered using COMMA for separating conjunction because this seems
   natural; think of the PRODUCES and CONSUMES clauses in function types.
   However, COMMA is already used to separate multiple arguments in a type
   application, so this means that parentheses will sometimes be necessary
   (e.g. when a conjunction of permissions is used as an argument in a type
   application). Even worse, COMMA is used in the syntax of tuples, and this
   leads to conflicts with tuple types and multi-argument function types.
   So, I give up and use a dedicated symbol, STAR, for conjunction. *)
