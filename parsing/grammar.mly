(* Syntactic categories of names. *)

(* Term variables, type variables, type constructors, fields are not
   syntactically distinguished. Placing term variables, type variables, and
   type constructors within a single syntactic category is natural because
   they share certain mechanisms (e.g. types and terms can be abstracted over
   them). They will be distinguished using sorts. Placing term variables and
   fields within a single syntactic category is required because we wish to
   allow puns. *)

(* Namespaces. *)

(* We work with several namespaces, each of which is obtained by applying

   should help us avoid confusions between namespaces: names for variables,
   data constructors, etc. have distinct types. *)

(* Syntax for tuples. *)

(* I considered using curly braces and semicolons, by analogy with
   records, but this would be too extreme: (1) it would impact the
   syntax of multiple-argument functions and (2) it would depart from
   the mathematical notation for tuples. *)

(* I thought for a moment that, in order to avoid a conflict with the
   standard use of parentheses as a desambiguation construct, tuples
   of length one would have to be made syntactically unavailable. I
   have changed my mind, because this position is untenable; tuples
   of length one are actually useful, e.g. in a function type of the
   form [(x: t) -> u] or [(consumes t) -> u]. So, my new position is,
   tuples are unrestricted, and there is no other use of parentheses.
   A post-processing phase determines how tuples of length one should
   be interpreted. *)

(* Syntax for type/type applications. *)

(* Applications of types to types are based on juxtaposition, just like
   applications of terms to terms. *)

(* Within the syntax of types, type/type applications are considered
   binary, but in certain places, as in the left-hand side of a data
   type definition, we must allow iterated applications. *)

%inline type_type_application(X, Y):

(* Syntax for binding type variables. *)

(* Because the syntax of type/type applications is juxtaposition, the
   syntax of type variable bindings must be atomic (well-delimited). *)

    { KArrow (kind1, kind2) }

(* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* Types and permissions. *)

(* Because types and permissions are distinguished via the kind system, they
   are not (and must not be) distinguished in the syntax. Thus, the
   productions that concern permissions (the empty permission, anchored
   permissions, permission conjunction, etc.) appear as part of the syntax of
   types. *)

(* Tuple types follow the Haskell style [(typ, ..., typ)] and can introduce
   names for their components [(x: typ, ..., x: typ)]. Every name is bound in
   every component, so mutual dependencies are allowed. Furthermore, if a
   tuple type appears on the left-hand side of an arrow, then the scope of
   these bindings extends to the right-hand side of the arrow. Anyway, these
   scoping rules have no influence on the grammar per se. *)

(* Function types take the traditional form [typ -> typ]. It is possible to
   write a multi-argument dependent function type [(x: typ, ..., x: typ) ->
   ... ]: it is interpreted syntactically as a function type whose domain
   is a tuple type. *)

(* There is a potential ambiguity because the anchored permission [x: typ] is
   an anchored permission, hence a type (of kind [KPerm]). This means that
   [(x: typ)] can be interpreted either as a tuple type whose component is
   named [x] and has type [typ] or as a tuple type whose anonymous component
   has type [x: typ]. Fortunately, the second alternative does not make sense,
   because a type that serves as a tuple component must have kind
   [KType]. Thus, we adjust the syntax of tuple types so that the types that
   appear within tuples cannot be anchored permissions. *)

(* We allow a component of a tuple type to carry the [CONSUMES] keyword. This
   does not make sense in a normal tuple type, but makes sense if this tuple
   serves as a function argument. It is up to a post-processing phase to check
   that [CONSUMES] is used only where it makes sense, and to desugar it. *)

%inline tuple_type_component:
  m = function_parameter_modifier (* optional CONSUMES annotation *)

   (permissions for) function arguments are consumed and produced. *)

function_parameter_modifier:
| (* by default, permission is consumed and produced *)
    { ConsumesAndProduces }
| CONSUMES
    { Consumes }

(* A tuple type component can be either a value (which exists at runtime)
   or a permission. This is natural, because we allow the same flexibility
   in records, and because we need this flexibility in order to specify
   function domains and codomains. If it is a value, it can be either
   anonymous or named. *)

(* I considered using COMMA for separating conjunction because this seems
   natural; think of the PRODUCES and CONSUMES clauses in function types.
   However, COMMA is already used to separate multiple arguments in a type
   application, so this means that parentheses will sometimes be necessary
   (e.g. when a conjunction of permissions is used as an argument in a type
   application). Even worse, COMMA is used in the syntax of tuples, and this
   leads to conflicts with tuple types and multi-argument function types.
   So, I give up and use a dedicated symbol, STAR, for conjunction. *)
