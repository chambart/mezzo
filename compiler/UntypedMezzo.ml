(* This is the definition of Untyped Mezzo. *)

(* This intermediate language differs from Surface Mezzo in a few (minor)
   ways, as follows. *)

(* Untyped Mezzo is untyped. *)

(* In Untyped Mezzo, the adopter fields are explicit, and the adoption and
   abandon operations are replaced with ordinary read and write operations. *)

(* In Untyped Mezzo, the overloading of field names is resolved: fields are
   unambiguously identified by a pair of a data constructor and a field
   name. *)

(* In Untyped Mezzo, the evaluation order is not guaranteed to be left-to-right.
   Where necessary, the translation of Mezzo to Untyped Mezzo introduces explicit
   sequencing constructs. *)

(* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* The patterns of Untyped Mezzo are those of Surface Mezzo. *)

(* A few constructors, such as [PLocated] and [PConstraint], are of no use,
   but we do not bother defining a new type of patterns for Untyped Mezzo. *)

(* In a [PConstruct] pattern, the adopter field never appears explicitly. *)
