Make Empty immutable in mutableTreeMap.mz. Understand the bug.

DataTypeFlavor.join is called in too many different places;
ideally, it should be called in just two (KindCheck, TransSurface)

SurfaceSyntax.mkdatacon_info is called several times (three?) per
datacon: this seems abnormal. 

Test that an MCons can be adopted and an MNil cannot.

Implement [slim]. Make sure that duplicable objects do not have an adopter
field. Update the comment in [mlist.mz].
