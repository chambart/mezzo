Make Empty immutable in mutableTreeMap.mz. Understand the bug.

DataTypeFlavor.join is called in too many different places;
ideally, it should be called in just two (KindCheck, TransSurface)

SurfaceSyntax.mkdatacon_info is called several times (three?) per
datacon: this seems abnormal. 

Test that an MCons can be adopted and an MNil cannot.

Allow "tag of <- " to move from an immutable tag to another immutable
tag provided the underlying integer tags are equal. Beware of the
possible separate numbering of constant tags.

Implement [slim]. Make sure that duplicable objects do not have an adopter
field. Update the comment in [mlist.mz].

If/when we adopt ocaml's representation for immutable constant tags, be
careful. They are not heap-allocated, and have separate numbering. A "tag of
<- " instruction from a constant mutable tag to a constant immutable tag will
not make sense.
