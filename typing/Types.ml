(* This module defines the syntax of types, as manipulated by the
   type-checker. *)

(* In the surface syntax, variables are named. Here, variables are
   represented as de Bruijn indices. We keep a variable name at each
   binding site as a pretty-printing hint. *)

type index =
  int

type level =
  int

module IndexMap = Hml_Map.Make(struct
  type t = index
  let compare = Pervasives.compare
end)

module LevelMap = IndexMap

type type_binding =
    SurfaceSyntax.type_binding

module DataconMap = Map.Make(struct
  type t = Datacon.name
  let compare = Pervasives.compare
end)

(* Record fields remain named. *)

module Field = Variable

(* The annotations [Consumes] and [ConsumesAndProduces] that appear in the
   surface syntax are desugared. They do not appear at this level. *)

(* In the surface syntax, tuple types can bind names for their components.
   Here, this is desugared using singleton types, universal quantification,
   and existential quantification. Tuple type components are now anonymous. *)

(* TEMPORARY we need a notion of type equality, or subtyping, that deals with
   quantifiers in a transparent way -- especially the quantifiers introduced
   by the translation of named tuple components down to this kernel syntax.
   E.g. we need (the translation of) [t] to be interconvertible with (the
   translation of) [(x: t)], which is [exists x :: term. (=x, permission x: t)].
   Hmm, tricky, tricky. Do we really want to go this way? *)

(* TEMPORARY also, subtyping must take into account the AC axioms for TyStar,
   the fact that TyEmpty is neutral for TyStar, and (perhaps) the fact that
   duplicable permissions are idempotent for TyStar. Tricky, tricky. *)

(* TEMPORARY also, subtyping must take into account the fact that tuple
   components which are anonymous permissions can freely move around
   within a tuple. Hmm, hmm. *)

(* TEMPORARY perhaps we could completely avoid the need for subtyping
   (and solve all three problems above) by working with explicit
   eta-expansions instead. This requires thought! *)

  (* TEMPORARY perhaps TyEmpty and TyStar can be removed because we already
               have TyTuple, which could serve to construct tuples of
               permissions. Investigate. *)
