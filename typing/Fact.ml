open Mode

(* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* A type variable that serves as a parameter in an algebraic data type
   definition is encoded as an integer. Referring to these variables as
   ``parameters'' helps avoid confusion with the use of the word ``variable''
   by the module [Fix]. *)

type parameter =
    int

module ParameterMap =
  Map.Make(struct
    type t = parameter
    let compare = Pervasives.compare
  end)

(* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* The lattice of facts. *)

(* A fact is a logical statement about the mode of a type [t] that has free
   variables, or in other words, about the mode of a parameterized type [t]. *)

(* Example facts are:
   
    duplicable int
    exclusive (ref a)
    duplicable a => duplicable (list a)
    duplicable a => duplicable b => duplicable (map a b)

  We may wish to allow several implications to concern the same type
  constructor. This could be useful, in particular, to deal with
  arrays. The type array could be exclusive or duplicable, depending
  on one of its parameters. Thus, the following conjunction of two
  implications would form a fact about the type array:

    duplicable m => duplicable a => duplicable (array m a)
    exclusive m => exclusive (array m a)

  Multiple implications are useful also for a more technical reason.
  In the base case of parameters, it seems convenient to write:

    duplicable a => duplicable a
    exclusive a => exclusive a

  and so on, for every mode. For these two reasons, I define a fact to
  be a conjunction of implications. The conclusion of each implication
  is a mode assertion of the form [m t], where the type [t] has free
  parameters. The hypotheses are mode assertions about these parameters.
  Distinct implications have distinct modes [m] in their conclusions,
  and we maintain a monotonicity property: if one implication is
  [h1 => m1 t] and another is [h2 => m2 t], where [m1 <= m2], then
  [h1] implies [h2]. This ensures that [h2] is indeed a necessary
  condition for [m2 t] to hold. *)

type property = fact

(* A fact about a type [t] is represented as a total function from
   a mode [m] -- the mode in the conclusion -- to a hypothesis [h].
   The type [t] is not explicitly represented. *)

and fact =
  hypothesis ModeMap.t

(* A hypothesis is either [false] or a conjunction of mode constraints
   bearing on the parameters. This conjunction is represented as a
   total function from parameters to modes. The domain of the parameters
   is finite and depends on the type [t]. It is not explicitly specified
   here. If a parameter is not explicitly mentioned in the conjunction,
   we assume that there is a trivial hypothesis about it, i.e., it is
   assumed to be affine. This convention allows the empty conjunction
   to be represetented by an empty map, independently of the number of
   parameters in existence. *)
