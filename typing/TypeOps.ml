(** [collect t] recursively walks down a type with kind KType, extracts all
    the permissions that appear in it (as tuple or record components), and
    returns the type without permissions as well as a list of types with kind
    KPerm, which represents all the permissions that were just extracted. *)

(** In fact, [collect] also calls itself recursively at kind KPerm, and
    is able to extract permissions out of permissions, e.g., to find a
    TyBar nested inside a TyAnchoredPermission. Because this behavior was
    not documented, I thought it was not essential, but it fact it is. *)
