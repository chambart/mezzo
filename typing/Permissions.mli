(** [collect t] recursively walks down a type with kind TYPE, extracts all
    the permissions that appear into it (as tuple or record components), and
    returns the type without permissions as well as a list of types with kind
    PERM, which represents all the permissions that were just extracted.
    
    FIXME: this function should not be exposed. *)
val collect: typ -> typ * typ list

(** [unify env p1 p2] merges two vars, and takes care of dealing with how the
    permissions should be merged. *)
val unify: env -> var -> var -> env

(** [add env var t] adds [t] to the list of permissions for [p], performing all
    the necessary legwork. *)
val add: env -> var -> typ -> env

(** [add_perm env t] adds a type [t] with kind PERM to [env], returning the new
    environment. *)
val add_perm: env -> typ -> env

(** [sub env var t] tries to extract [t] from the available permissions for
    [var] and returns, if successful, the resulting environment. *)
val sub: env -> var -> typ -> env option

(** [sub_type env t1 t2] tries to perform [t1 - t2]. It is up to
 * the caller to "do the right thing" by not discarding [t1] if it was not
 * duplicable. Unifications may be performed, hence the return environment. *)
