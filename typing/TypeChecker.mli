(** [check_declaration_group env declarations items] type-checks a set of
 * top-level [declarations]; in order to do that, it will end up opening certain
 * binders, which is why it takes a list of [items] which will be correctly
 * transformed so as to refer to the variables that have been opened. It returns
 * an environment, the transformed [items], and the list of opened variables. *)
