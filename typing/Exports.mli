(** Handling the names exported by interfaces and implementations. *)

(** From a very high-level perspective, the type-checker needs to maintain a map
 * from names to [TypeCore.var]s.
 *   - We need to map _qualified_ names to [var]s (What is the [var] that stands
 *   for "int::int"?), and
 *   - we need to map _unqualified_ names to [var]s (This implementation
 *   contains "val x". Which [var] is "x"?)
 *
 * Qualified names are added to this map when importing an interface.
 * Unqualified names are added when type-checking an implementation.
 *
 * What does this have to do with kind-check? Well, kind-check expects an
 * environment where all required interfaces have been _imported_. This means
 * that if there is an occurrence of module "m" in implementation "impl", then
 * kind-checking expects "m::x" to be available in the environment. Opening a
 * module is managed internally by [KindCheck] and [TransSurface].
 *
 * Rather than using a separate, high-level environment, which we would inject
 * into the kind-checking environment, we cheat and reuse kind-checking
 * environments as high-level environments. The invariant is that a high-level
 * environment only contains [NonLocal] bindings, either qualified or
 * unqualified. *)


(** This is the type of a high-level environment. *)
