open TypeCore

(* This function hoists [TyAnd] constructs out of a type. This allows mode
   constraints to become visible as early as possible. This can be useful
   when trying to prove that a type admits a certain mode. *)

(* This is a relatively unambitious hoisting transformation: we stop at
   quantifiers (i.e. we do not go down into them, and we do not hoist
   constraints out of them). In principle, we could hoist a constraint
   out of a quantifier if the quantified variable is not free in it; or,
   more generally, we could hoist not only constraints, but also quantifiers,
   up to the toplevel. This would probably be essentially useless, though,
   as we do not expect the programmer to write a mode constraint at an
   unnecessarily deep position, under a quantifier. (Actually, even the
   current transformation might be useless? Well, it will allow us to
   prove, for instance, that {a} (a, (duplicable a | ())) is duplicable.) *)

val hoist: env -> typ -> typ

(* This function extracts the [TyAnd] constructs that are found at the
   root of a type. *)
