    [c] is assumed (i.e., it is added to the environment as a new
    hypothesis). *)
val assume: env -> mode_constraint -> env

(** [analyze_data_types env vars] assumes that [vars] forms a group of
    mutually recursive algebraic data type definitions. It assumes that
    the members of [vars] which are *abstract* data types have already
    received a fact in [env]. It synthesizes a fact for the members of
    [vars] which are *concrete* data types, and adds these facts to the
    environment, producing a new environment. *)

    satisfied, using the information stored in [env] about the ambient
    type definitions and mode assumptions. *)
