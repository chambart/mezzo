     variable with the most precise mode, [Mode.bottom]. This is logically
     equivalent to replacing this variable with the type [TyBottom]. *)

  (* In the existential case, it appears, at first sight, that we must
     associate this variable with the least precise mode, [Mode.top].
     However, that would be a bit over-conservative. We would like to
     be able to establish the following facts:

       exclusive  ({a} (exclusive  a /\ a))
       duplicable ({a} (duplicable a /\ a))

     and, slightly more difficult,

       duplicable ({a} (a, (duplicable a /\ a)))

     This suggests that, when we enter an existential quantifier, we must
     descend in the structure and look for assumption about the quantified
     variable that can be hoisted out. *)
