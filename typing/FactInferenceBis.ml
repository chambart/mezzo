  (* The existential type {a} (exclusive a /\ a) is exclusive.
     Similarly, {a} (duplicable a /\ a) is duplicable. When we
     find a [TyAnd] node, we should be able to assume that the
     constraint holds before continuing. Technically, the type
     {a} (a, (duplicable a /\ a)) is duplicable too; in order
     to be able to prove this, we might need to defer our answer
     at variables. *)

  (* The type c => t is equivalent to t if the constraint holds,
     and is equivalent to unknown otherwise. Thus, this type is
     exclusive only if c holds and t is exclusive. However, we
     do not know if c holds, and the question does not really
     make sense, as it makes the system non-monotonic. Consider
     the following recursive abbreviation:

     alias t = (duplicable t => ref int)

     If t is duplicable, then t is logically equivalent to ref
     int, so t is exclusive. If t is exclusive, then t is not
     duplicable (? presumably t is not bottom), so t is logically
     equivalent to unknown, so t is duplicable. This is completely
     inconsistent!

     In order to avoid these problems, it seems reasonable to say
     that a type of the form c => t is never exclusive, period. *)
