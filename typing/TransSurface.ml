   - All implicit name bindings made through [TyNameIntro] are turned into
     explicit quantifiers, either [TyForall] or [TyExists].
   - Function parameters that are not consumed, when desugared, generate a
     permission in the returned type. [TyConsumes] annotations are removed.
   - Type annotations in patterns are removed, and are attached to let or val
     bindings instead.
   - Location information inside types and patterns is dropped.
