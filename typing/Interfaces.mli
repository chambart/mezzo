(** Check a module against an interface / import an interface into scope. *)

(** Because this is a tricky operation, the [check] function needs access to
 * both the internal representation of the type-checked file (this is a
 * {!TypeCore.env}), the external representation of the interface (this is a
 * {!SurfaceSyntax.interface}), and the list of exported variables from the
 * implementation, along with their canonical names and kinds ({!Driver} knows
 * how to figure that out).
 *
 * This is not only about checking that a module satisfies its interface, but
 * also about checking that a module does not alter other interfaces. The
 * implementation has more comments along with the code. *)
