  (* When tackling a merge job between points [left_point] and [right_point],

    on 2012/06/28):
    i. neither [left_point] or [right_point] are mapped: update the mapping with
      the point that has been allocated for them in the destination environment;
    ii. [left_point] and [right_point] are mapped already:
      a. they point to the expected point in the destination environment: this is
        great!
      b. they point to a different point [p']: merge [dest_point] with [p']
        (situation 2 in the notebook),
    iii. either one of them is not mapped, or the two are mapped and point to
      conflicting points in the destination environment: this means a different
      decision has been made, and we need to bail out. This will result in no
      permissions for the allocated point, and we just learnt that this merge
      situation is not principal (situation 1 in the notebook).
