# The general set of flags for compiling Mezzo.
# - We enable debug information.
# - Menhir is our parser generator.
# - We use the following libraries: Ocamlbuild_Plugin, Unix, Str
# - We generate .annot files and .cmt files.
# - We use the following ocamlfind packages: yojson, menhirlib, ulex, pprint

# - We normally need use_unix, but testsuite.* needs package(functory) instead
#   (for some reason, functory seems to include unix)

true: debug, \
  use_menhir, use_ocamlbuild, \
  annot, bin_annot, strict_sequence, \
  package(yojson), package(menhirLib), package(ulex), package(pprint), \
