The language yet-to-be-named requires:
- OCaml 4.00
- a properly-working ocamlfind command,
- the following packages: menhirLib, yojson

These packages are present in Debian but Debian hasn't switched to OCaml 4.00
yet. We recommend odb.ml <https://github.com/thelema/odb> to easily install
these dependencies.
