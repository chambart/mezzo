(* Physical equality, a primitive operation, returns a rich Boolean value.
   Deconstructing [x == y] yields, in the [RichTrue] branch, an equality
   between [x] and [y]. *)

val ( == ) : (x: unknown, y: unknown) -> rich_bool (x = y) empty
val ( != ) : (x: unknown, y: unknown) -> rich_bool empty (x = y)
