(* We could assign precise types to the constructors: [none] has type [None],
   and [some x] has type [Some { contents: a }] if [x] has type [a]. For the
   moment, let's try and see if we can work with the following more abstract
   types. *)

val none : [a] option a
val some : [a] (consumes a) -> option a

(* A destructor, which can fail at runtime. *)
