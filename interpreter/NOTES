Think about the treatment of compilation units.
  Careful: not all toplevel names are exported.
  Careful: some toplevel names can be re-defined before they are exported. (Bad?)

It would be nice if toplevel names could be distinguished from local names
(even when not qualified, and even when referring to a toplevel definition in
the current module). Provided toplevel names cannot be re-defined, this would
allow us to construct lightweight closures, i.e., not include toplevel names
as part of closures. Actually, perhaps we should distinguish the global
environment and the local environment? (Closures would include only the
latter.)
