(* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* The interpreter treats data constructor definitions as generative. That is,
   the evaluation of a data constructor definition causes the generation of a
   fresh information record, to which the data constructor becomes bound. (This
   information record could in principle contain a unique identifier; it
   doesn't, because we don't need it.) Data constructors are treated just like
   variables: i.e., they are bound in the environment. This implies, for
   instance, that if a function refers to a data constructor, then this data
   constructor is interpreted in the closure's environment. We adopt this
   approach because it seems simple, efficient, and deals correctly with
   masking. *)

(* We maintain the following information about every data constructor. *)

type datacon_info = {
  (* Its arity (i.e., number of fields). *)
  datacon_arity: int;
  (* Its integer index within its data type definition. *)
  datacon_index: int;
  (* A map of field names to field indices. *)
  datacon_fields: int Variable.Map.t;
}

(* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* Thus, we have two namespaces: variables and data constructors. *)

module V =
  InterpreterNamespace.MakeNamespace(Variable)

module D =
  InterpreterNamespace.MakeNamespace(Datacon)

(* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* An environment contains the following information: *)

type env = {
    (* A map of (unqualified or qualified) variables to values. *)
    variables: value V.global_env;
    (* A map of (unqualified) data constructors to data constructor information. *)
    datacons: datacon_info D.global_env;
}

(* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* A value is one of the following: *)

and value =
    (* A primitive integer value. *)
  | VInt of int
    (* The address of a memory block. *)
  | VAddress of block
    (* A tuple. *)
  | VTuple of value list
    (* A closure. *)
  | VClosure of closure

(* A memory block contains the following information: *)

and block = {
  (* An integer tag, i.e., a [datacon_index]. *)
  mutable tag: int;
  (* An adopter pointer, which is either null or the address of some other block. *)
  mutable adopter: block option;
  (* A set of fields. *)
  fields: value (* mutable *) array;
}

(* A closure contains the following information: *)

and closure = {
  (* The function's formal argument, a pattern. *)
  arg: pattern;
  (* The function's body, an expression. *)
  body: expression;
  (* The environment. *)
  (* This field is mutable only in order to allow initializing
     a recursive closure (this is Landin's knot). *)
  mutable env: env;
}
