(* val x () : (i: int, j: =i) = (2, 2) *)
(* This example shows that, by assigning type "int" to the constant
   2, we lose information. I am not sure what to do about it,
   though. In an extension of Mezzo with arithmetic formulae,
   perhaps 2 could/should have type (x: int | x = 2). Below is a
   workaround where the programmer suggests
   that he wishes to keep track of the equality. *)

val x () : (i: int, j: =i) =
  let k = 2 in
  (k, k)
