data t = 
  A | B

val a : A =
  A

data u =

val f (x : u) : int =
  match x with

  | B -> 1
  end

(* At the time of writing, this .mzi/.mz pair is accepted.
   One could however argue that it should be rejected, but
   the data constructors A and B that are in scope at the
   end of the .mz file are those of u, yet the data constructors
   that are exported are those of t. Weird. *)

(* I would suggest forbidding duplicate data constructor
   definitions in .mz files. *)

(* jp: I don't really agree, OCaml has the exact same behavior, and I believe
 * it's sometimes useful to shadow existing data constructors, as long as the data
 * constructor appears just once in the interface. *)
