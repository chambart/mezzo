val f : int -> int =
  magic::magic (fun (x : int) : int = x)

val x : int =
  f 0

(* BUG I get the message:

 f is not a function, it has type:
[/g70]
  /g70

this seems to show that the type of f in the environment is
[a] a, even though we have specifically asked for a weaker
type. *)

(* Furthermore, technically, a value of type [a] a should be
   accepted as a valid function... *)
