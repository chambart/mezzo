val id [a] (consumes x: a) : a =
  x

val id_bis : [b] (consumes x: b) -> b =
  id

val zero : int =
  id [b = int] 0

(* BUG I get an error message telling me that "id does not have a
   polymorphic type"; the message should instead be something like "id
   does not have a quantifier labelled b" *)

val zero_bis : int =
  id_bis [b = int] 0

(* BUG this is rejected; one might expect it to be accepted *)

(* It is not clear to me that it is possible to fix these bugs; I
   believe we lack a clear spec of what we are trying to do here. *)
