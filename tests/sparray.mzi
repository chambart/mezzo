(* An attempt at semi-persistent arrays, using one-shot functions
   to encode the "arrow" permissions associated to rollback. *)
(* The current implementation is as close as possible to FranÃ§ois's
   example. *)

abstract sparray a

(* The current implementation is as follows. However, the only
   function whose type requires that knowledge is [reroot], and
   we do not need to show this function to the user, hence the
   type is kept abstract here. *)

(* The function [set] also requires some knowledge about the
   internal representation of [sparray] if one-shot functions
   are not used properly. *)

(*
data mutable sparray a =
  | SPArray { repr: repr a }

data mutable repr a =
  | RFlat { contents: array a }
  | RUndo { descendant: sparray a; offset: int; element: a }
*)


val create: [a] duplicable a => (int, a) -> sparray a

(* Reroot is not needed in the interface, and it refers to the
   internal representation, so it is commented here. *)
(*
val reroot: [a] (consumes spa: sparray a) ->
  ( | spa @ SPArray { repr: RFlat { contents: array a } })
*)

val get: [a] duplicable a => (sparray a, int) -> a

(* The function [set] consumes a semi-persistent array [spa]
   and returns two things:
   - an updated semi-persistent array [spa'], and
   - a void one-shot function [back] that allows one to retrieve
     a permission on [spa] by giving up the permission on [spa'].
*)

(* The one-shot function is a record that contains a hidden
   (existentially quantified) permission. This permission concerns
   the root of [spa] as well as the diff between [spa] and [spa'].
   It is used to retrieve [spa] from [spa']. *)

(* Remark: in this version, the rollback functions have to be
   applied explicitely! It would be nice to also have some
   automation here. *)

val set: [a] duplicable a =>
  (consumes spa: sparray a, offset: int, element: a) ->
  (spa': sparray a,
   back: osf ( | spa' @ sparray a) ( | spa @ sparray a) )

(* Below, a version of [set] where one-shot functions are not used.
   It requires a hard-wired representation of [sparray] in which a
   kind of magic wand is encoded by hand. *)

(*
val set: [a] duplicable a =>
  (consumes spa: sparray a, offset: int, element: a) ->
  (spa': sparray a,
   back: ( | consumes (spa' @ sparray a * spa @ SPArray {
			  repr: RUndo {
			    descendant: =spa'; offset: int; element: a
			  } 
			})) -> ( | spa @ sparray a) )
*)
