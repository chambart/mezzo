Non-problems:
-------------

Failures (should be fixed):
---------------------------
  in_place_traversal2.mz: missing implementation for the [this] keyword
  merge17.mz: type-checker loops
  list-map3.mz: TODO implement permissions not yet attached to a point
  pattern2.mz: can't match on a structural type...
  adopts11.mz: an assert failure (all types should be in expanded form)

Could be improved:
------------------
  adopts10.mz:
    Initially, an assert failure (merging cons vs cons without a destination
    point). Solved by requiring that the adopts clauses agree when merging, but
    could conceivably be improved to work.
  list-concat-dup.mz:
    we could perform the subtraction on duplicable α ⇒ τ with α flexible by
    first performing the subtraction on τ, and then checking whether α has been
    instantiated, and whether it is now duplicable.
  xlist-copy.mz:
    idem

Misc:
-----

for a in *.mz; do
  if ! grep "$a" ../testsuite.ml > /dev/null 2>&1 ; then
    echo $a;
  fi;
done | sort
