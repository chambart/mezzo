Non-problems:
-------------

Failures (should be fixed):
---------------------------
  in_place_traversal2.mz: missing implementation for the [this] keyword
  merge17.mz: type-checker loops
  adopts11.mz: an assert failure (all types should be in expanded form)
  landin.mz: type-checker loops (*may* be solved by implementing the rule that
    says that we should strip out exclusive permissions from the environment
    before comparing function types, I'm not sure of that though)

Could be improved:
------------------
  adopts10.mz:
    Initially, an assert failure (merging cons vs cons without a destination
    point). Solved by requiring that the adopts clauses agree when merging, but
    could conceivably be improved to work.

Misc:
-----

for a in *.mz; do
  if ! grep "$a" ../testsuite.ml > /dev/null 2>&1 ; then
    echo $a;
  fi;
done | sort
