open list

(* francois: IMHO, this test has nothing to do with the
   value restriction; it only checks that there is no
   permission for [r] inside the anonymous function. *)

val wrong =
  let r = Ref { contents = Nil } in
  fun [a] (x: a): () =
    r.contents <- Cons { head = x; tail = r.contents }
