(* This code is accepted if I change the second "x:" to "y:".
   My guess is that there is a name capture problem in the
   desugaring of types, when "x @ ref int" is copied to the
   result type. We should decide: 1. is this code supposed
   to be accepted? 2. if yes, fix the bug; 3. if no, reject
   this code with a reasonable error message. *)

val deref (x: ref int) : (x: int) =
