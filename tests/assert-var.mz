(* This code should be rejected because the .mz and .mzi files disagree.
   Instead, we obtain an internal error: [assert_var] failed (empty is not a var) *)

(* jonathan: Actually, this code succeeds, because the function below returns
 * the [a] of our choice, so we can subtype the function below, using
 * Î·-expansion.
 * Step 1: p * (| consumes p) -> a <= () -> a (function)
 * Step 2: () -> a <= (x: = x) -> a (function, decompose, etc.)
 * Step 3: instantiate a with "(| consumes p) -> a".
