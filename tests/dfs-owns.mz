open list

(* It would be great if we could abstract this code so as to work
   with an arbitrary graph structure. For the moment, let's work
   with a fixed, dummy type of graphs. *)

(* The [graph] object contains the list of the graph's roots, and
   also serves as an adopter for the graph nodes. *)

(* The type parameter [a] is the type of the information contained
   in each graph node. *)

mutable data graph a =
  Graph { roots: list dynamic } adopts node a

mutable data node a =
  Node  { children: list dynamic; payload: a }

(* Depth-first (prefix) numbering. *)

(* [traverse] performs a strong update on a composite structure: the
   type of the graph changes from [graph unknown] to [graph int], or
   in other words, the type of every node changes from [node unknown]
   to [node int]. *)

(* In this variant, we do not need each node to carry a Boolean mark.
   Instead, we use the hidden [adopter] field for this purpose. If a
   node is currently adopted by the old graph, then it has not been
   visited yet. If it is adopted by the new graph, then it has been
   visited. This technique presents several advantages with respect to
   a more na√Øve approach based on Boolean marks: 1- it saves space; 2-
   it does not require the marks to be re-initialized after (or before)
   each traversal; 3- it allows a strong update, i.e. the nodes that
   have been visited do not have the same type as the nodes that have
   not yet been visited. *)

val traverse (consumes g : graph unknown) : graph int =
  
  (* This integer reference counts how many nodes we have discovered. *)
  let c = newref 0 in

  (* This is the new graph. *)
  let newGraph = Graph { roots = g.roots } in

  (* The recursive function. *)
  let rec visit (n : dynamic | g @ graph unknown * c @ ref int * newGraph @ graph int) : () =
    (* Perform a dynamic ownership test. *)
    if g owns n then begin
      (* This node has not been visited yet. *)
      take n from g;
      (* Number this node. *)
      n.payload <- !c;
      c := !c + 1;
      let children = n.children in
      (* Mark this node as visited by giving it to the new graph. *)
      give n to newGraph;
      iter (visit, children)
    end
  in

  (* Visit each of the roots. *)
  iter (visit, g.roots);

  (* Return the new graph. *)
  newGraph
