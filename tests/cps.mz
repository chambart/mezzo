(* An implementation of the delimited (composable) continuation monad. *)

(* We manipulate computations of type (a -> b) -> c, where:

   a :          result type; the continuation's argument type
   b : internal answer type; the continuation's return type
   c : external answer type; the computation's return type *)

(* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ *)

(* Monadic Return. *)

(* Usually, [return] has type [a, b] (x : a) -> (a -> b) -> b. *)

(* It seems that we must restrict [a] to be duplicable, because the value [x]
   is captured by the lambda-abstraction [\k.k x]. The other option would be
   to make this lambda-abstraction a one-shot function (assuming that we have
   one-shot functions). But this would force us to work with computations of
   type (a -> b) -1-> c. Then, in the definition of [bind], we would have to
   guarantee that the application [r x k] takes place at most once, so we
   would have to guarantee that [l] invokes its continuation at most once,
   so would be forced to work with computations of type (a -1-> b) -1-> c.
   Thus, the continuation captured by [shift] would be one-shot. This might
   be sufficient for some applications (e.g., inverting a fold), but I would
   prefer to avoid it. *)

(* Requiring that [a] be duplicable is a strong restriction. We can relax this
   type, however, by threading a permission through our computations. In general,
   we can work with computations of type:

     ((a | consumes post) -> b | consumes pre) -> c
     where a is duplicable
   
   Thus, each the two arrows above expects an argument of duplicable type
   (either a, or (a | consumes post) -> b), but also expects a permission,
   pre or post, which may or may not be duplicable. The permission pre is
   the precondition of the computation; the permission post is the
   precondition of the continuation, hence the internal postcondition
   of the computation. *)

(* I believe that this approach might give us the best of the two worlds:
   one-shot functions when we need them, and multi-shot functions otherwise.
   Indeed, a function that happens to preserve its precondition can be
   invoked multiple times, whereas a function that consumes (or transforms)
   its precondition can be invoked at most once. Thus, for various choices
   of [pre] and [post], we get one-shot or multi-shot functions. *)

(* I am worried, though, that in general we would like the postcondition
   to depend on the result [x], so the type of computations should be:

     ((x: a | consumes post x) -> b | consumes pre) -> c
     where a is duplicable
   
   Because we do not have higher-order quantification, we cannot express
   [bind] for computations of this type. *)

(* AH -- maybe there is no point in describing the argument of the
   continuation as (x: a | consumes post x). Indeed, this amounts to
   splitting the argument type between a duplicable part [x: a] and a
   possibly-non-duplicable part [post x]. Could we instead just write
   (consumes x: a)? NO. In the case of [return], we do need to split
   [a] and [p]. In the case of [bind], we do need to split [a] and
   [middle]. *)

(* In the case of [return], of course, [pre] and [post] must coincide. The
   permission [p] is not required to be duplicable. *)

val return
  [a, b, p : perm]
  duplicable a =>
  (x : a) : ((a | consumes p) -> b | consumes p) -> b =
  fun  (k :  (a | consumes p) -> b | consumes p)  : b =
    k x

(* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ *)

(* Monadic Bind. *)

(* Although the type annotations make this code unreadable, it is just the
   expected code, with its most general ML type, extended with permissions
   [pre], [middle], and [post], which form a Hoare-like sequencing rule.
   One simplification is that [a1] and [post] always appear together, so
   we can use just [consumes a1] instead of [a1 | consumes post], without
   loss of generality. *)

(* Note that, although [a] is not technically required to be duplicable,
   it will usually be duplicable, since the curried function [r] would
   otherwise not be able to do anything useful with its first arugment. *)

(* We define [bind] as a two-argument function; it does not need to be
   curried. In the [do]-notation, [bind] is applied to two arguments at
   once. This saves us one large type annotation. *)

(* It would be nice if we could uncurry [r] as well, as this would allow us
   to merge [a1] and [middle], but I don't think that is possible. In
   the [do]-notation, the second argument to [bind] is a lambda-abstraction
   of one argument. *)

val bind
  [a, a1, b, b1, c, pre : perm, middle : perm]
  (l : ((a | consumes middle) -> b | consumes pre) -> c,
   r : a -> ((consumes a1) -> b1 | consumes middle) -> b) :
  (k : (consumes a1) -> b1 | consumes pre) -> c
  =
  fun (k : (consumes a1) -> b1 | consumes pre) : c =
    l (fun (x : a | consumes middle) : b =
      r x k
    )

(* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ *)

(* Reset. *)

(* Here, [reify] is the identity, and [reset c] is implemented by passing an
   identity continuation to the computation [c]. We do not re-package the
   resulting value as a computation (i.e., we do not pass it to [return]),
   because we are in a two-layer world, where the code outside of [reset]
   is not monadic. *)

(* The type of the identity, in Mezzo, is [(consumes a) -> a]. This is
   equivalent, I believe, to [(a | p) -> a], where [a] is required to
   be duplicable. *)

val reset [a, b] (c: ((consumes a) -> a) -> b) : b =
  c (fun (consumes x : a) : a = x)

(* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ *)

(* Shift. *)

(* Here, [shift] is the identity. When one wishes to capture the current
   continuation, one simply writes [fun (k: a -> b) : c = ...], and
   presto, this is a computation that has access to its continuation. *)

(* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ *)

(* Higher-order list iteration in CPS style. *)

(* TEMPORARY this code needs to be generalized in order to allow [f]
   to perform a side effect on some state [s]. *)

   of [cps_iter]. We must store a pair of the continuation
   and the permission [q] that it requires -- this is

   an existential quantification over [q]. (An attempt to
   parameterize the type [iterator] over [q] would fail,
   as we would not know which parameter to supply in the

(* In a sense, the existential quantification over [pre] serves
