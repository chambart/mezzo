(* This test should fail because the type declared in the
   .mzi file is strictly more powerful than this one --
   the universal quantifier appears on the right-hand side
   of the arrow. Pushing a universal quantifier into an
   arrow, like this, violates the value restriction. The
   relaxed value restriction does not help us, here, because
   the variable a appears co- and contra-variantly. *)
