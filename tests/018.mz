(* Success: 5 *)
data pair a b = Pair { left: a; right: b }
val make () : pair int int =
  Pair { left = 10; right = 5 }
val () =
  match make() with Pair { right; left } -> print (left - right) end
  (* BUG: this is rejected;
          but writing "left; right" instead of "right; left" makes it OK *)
