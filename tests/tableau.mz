(* We wish to distinguish mutable and immutable arrays, so the type
   of arrays takes the form [array m a], where the phantom parameter
   [m] is intended to be either [ro] or [rw]. The type parameter [a]
   represents the type of the elements of the array. It is always a
   duplicable type. *)

abstract ro
fact duplicable ro

abstract rw
fact exclusive rw

abstract array m a
fact duplicable m => duplicable (array m a)
(* WISH I would like to also write:
fact exclusive m => exclusive (array m a)
*)
