(* The idea is that we want to write the following impredicative type:
  * "∀α. α -> (∀β. (α, β) -> α) -> α". The problem is that we don't have native closures,
  * so this is tedious to write, especially because of consumes annotations. *)

data foo = Foo

val fst [α, β] (consumes x: α, β): α = x

(* Ok, I don't think we can expect a mere mortal to understand this type. We
 * should have a pre-processing phase that automatically inserts the consumes
 * annotations for the arguments that the function closes over, so that we can
 * write functions with multiple arguments in a fairly natural style. *)
val id [α] (x: α): ([β] (α, β) -> α | x @ α) -> α =
  fun (f: [β] ((α, β) -> α) | x @ α): α =
    f [int] (x, 2)

val (test: foo) = (id [foo]) Foo (fst [foo])
