open list

(* Interesting example: in OCaml, this code can be written, but the
   type-checker forces the equality of the types [a] and [b]. *)

val rec map [a, b] (xs: list a, f : a -> b) : list b =
  match xs with
  | Nil ->
      xs
  | Cons { head; tail } ->
      let head' = f head in
      let tail' = map (xs.tail, f) in
      let e1: rich_bool empty (head = head' * tail = tail') =
        head == head' && tail == tail'
      in
      if e1 then begin
        assert head = head'; (* BUG? why is this equality not known? *)
        assert tail = tail';
        xs
      end
      else
        Cons { head = head'; tail = tail' }
  end
