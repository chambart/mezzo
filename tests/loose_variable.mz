(* There's an uninstanciated type variable hanging around, it's innocuous, but I
 * wanted to write down that specific case. *)
val length [a] (list::list a): int =
  fail

val the_length = length Pervasives::nil
  (* BUG: this code causes the type-checker to raise Not_found
     once the bug is fixed, change the above Pervasives to list *)
